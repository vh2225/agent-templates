# Quick Start Guide - Agent Framework Implementation

## 🚀 5-Minute Setup for New Projects

### **Step 1: Choose Your Framework**
```bash
# Option A: Full BMAD Framework (Large Projects)
cp agent-templates/BMAD_FRAMEWORK.md your-project/AGENTS.md

# Option B: Simple Team Structure (Small Projects)
cp agent-templates/AGENT_ORG_STRUCTURE.md your-project/TEAM.md

# Option C: Custom Hybrid (Medium Projects)
# Combine elements from both templates
```

### **Step 2: Define Your Project Type**
```yaml
Project_Classification:
  Size: [Small|Medium|Large|Enterprise]
  Duration: [Weeks|Months|Quarters]
  Team_Size: [1-5|6-15|16-50|50+]
  Complexity: [Simple|Moderate|Complex|Critical]
  Domain: [Web|Mobile|AI/ML|IoT|Blockchain|Other]
```

### **Step 3: Select Your Agents**

#### **Minimum Viable Team (MVP)**
```yaml
Essential_Agents: # For any project
  - Build_Agent: Core development
  - QA_Agent: Quality assurance
  - Deploy_Agent: Deployment & operations

Small_Project: # 1-3 month projects
  - Build_Agent
  - QA_Agent
  - Deploy_Agent

Medium_Project: # 3-6 month projects
  - Product_Manager
  - Build_Agent (2x)
  - QA_Agent
  - Data_Agent
  - Deploy_Agent

Large_Project: # 6+ month projects
  - CTO_Agent

  - Project_Coordinator
  - Build_Team (3-5 agents)
  - Measure_Team (2-3 agents)
  - Analyze_Team (2-3 agents)
  - Deploy_Team (2-3 agents)
```

### **Step 4: Initialize Project Structure**
```bash
# Create project directory structure
mkdir -p your-project/{docs,src,tests,configs,agents}

# Copy agent templates
cp agent-templates/* your-project/agents/

# Create agent assignment file
cat > your-project/agents/ASSIGNMENTS.md << EOF
# Agent Assignments for [Your Project Name]

## Active Agents
- Build Lead: [Agent Name]
- QA Lead: [Agent Name]
- DevOps Lead: [Agent Name]

## Phase Schedule
- Phase 1 (BUILD): Week 1-4
- Phase 2 (MEASURE): Week 5-6
- Phase 3 (ANALYZE): Week 7-8
- Phase 4 (DEPLOY): Week 9-10
EOF
```
