### 1.1 Example Response to LLM Questions

Let me explain what Levercast is. It's an application that helps entrepreneurs manage their social media posting more efficiently. Often when I'm reading an article or taking a walk, I'll come up with an idea for a thought piece or article. I want to quickly capture that idea through voice or text input. The app has an input box where I can dump these thoughts.

The input then gets sent to an LLM that formats it based on custom template prompts I've set up in the application. It returns a tidied version of my thoughts, but it does more than thatâ€”it generates multiple versions optimized for different social platforms. For our MVP, we'll focus on LinkedIn and Twitter posts, with plans to add more platforms later.

These generated posts will appear styled exactly as they would on their respective platforms, making it easy to preview the formatting. I can also add images to my input, and the app will adapt them appropriately for each platform. I can edit any of the outputs, and when I'm satisfied, publish them directly to those platforms. We'll use OAuth to connect Levercast with LinkedIn and Twitter accounts.

In essence, Levercast helps busy entrepreneurs capture ideas and share them quickly across multiple platforms simultaneously. The key benefit is saving time while amplifying marketing efforts. As for the user interface, while I'll leave the specific design details to a professional designer, I know it will be a web application initially, with responsive design to support mobile access in the future.

### 2.1 Example UX Model Response

Below is a summary of our initial thoughts based on the Levercast Product Requirements Document. Before moving forward, I have a few clarifying questions regarding the user persona and design preferences:

1. **User Persona Details:**
    
    - While we know the app targets busy entrepreneurs, business owners, content creators, and marketers, could you provide more details on their digital proficiency or any particular design preferences?
    - Do they prefer a minimalistic, no-frills interface that emphasizes efficiency, or are they open to a more dynamic, visually engaging experience?
2. **Branding & Color Preferences:**
    
    - Are there any existing brand colors or style guidelines we should incorporate into the design?
    - Would you like the design to offer options like a dark mode, or should we stick to a light, clean palette?
3. **Device Prioritization:**
    
    - Although the PRD mentions a desktop-first approach, should we factor in early considerations for mobile responsiveness?

Based on the current PRD, here are **three UI design options** that might suit your needs:

#### Option 1: Minimalist Modern Dashboard

### 2.2 Example Response to UX Questions

On user persona details, I think these entrepreneurs are particularly digitally proficient. The selling point of this app is that it's not just another generic posting platformâ€”it gives users the power to change their templates and properties. We're targeting more of a power user market. While others might use Buffer or Hootsuite, this is really for entrepreneurs who want to fine-tune their language, voice, and edit their own properties.

In terms of design, I prefer making things as minimalistic as possible. However, since users need options to change templates and customize settings, a balanced approach makes sense. Regarding branding and color preferences, I'll defer to your judgment based on our target market. Since we're targeting the development community and solopreneur makers, dark mode will likely be popular. For accessibility, we'll offer a light mode option as well, so our color scheme needs to accommodate both.

For devices, we're taking a desktop-first approach, but the app should be mobile responsive so users can operate it on phones and tablets. This will also inform our future React Native application development.

### 2.3 Example Final Selection Response

I think out of the three options I like number two the most. Let's lead with dark mode. Let's add the accent color to be yellow and I'd like the option to be able to switch to light mode, of course for accessibility. I'd like the main navigation to be handled in the left hand sidebar, which can be collapsed. That will have the ability to create a new post. It'll show all the recent posts. It will have a settings and a templates link. And whenever you navigate in the left hand menu, those components are opened in the main content area and at the bottom left of the sidebar put in the profile icon of the person when they click on that it's gonna allow them to log out.

### 2.4 Example Final UI Design Document

# Levercast User Interface Design Document

This document outlines the final UI design for Levercast, incorporating a bold, creative dark mode with a yellow accent color and an option to switch to light mode for enhanced accessibility.
